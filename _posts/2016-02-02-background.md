While exploring armature building in Blender, I searched for an easy way to mirror bone constraints from one side of the rig to the other. There are two easy-to-find candidates.

The first I hit upon was the response by prolific Stack Exchange user TLousky to [this question] (http://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/41709/how-to-copy-constraints-from-one-bone-to-another). The script ran all right on my armature, but some of the constraint parameters were not as I'd expect for my rig and my constraints. This script was posted in response to a question about constraints on bones used to control shape keys, so it's worth checking out for that use case.

The other result was a Blender add-on called [Pose Mirror](https://developer.blender.org/T36334) dating from 2013 by Connor Simpson.
